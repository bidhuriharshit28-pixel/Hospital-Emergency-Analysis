# Key Insights – July Emergency Dashboard
Patient Volume & Admission

A total of 488 patients visited the emergency department.
55% (266 patients) were admitted, while 45% (222 patients) were not.
This indicates that more than half of the emergency cases required hospitalization.
Wait Time & Patient Experience
The average wait time is 35.20 minutes, which is relatively high and shows room for operational improvement.
Despite the wait, the patient satisfaction score is strong at 4.79/5, reflecting positive overall experience.

#Timeliness of Service
59% of patients were attended on time, while 41% experienced delays.
The delay percentage is significant and needs to be reduced for better service quality.

#Gender Analysis
Patient distribution is nearly balanced: 52% male and 48% female.
This suggests equitable healthcare access across genders.

#Age Group Trends
Highest patient volumes were seen in 10–19 years (73), 40–49 years (72), and 50–59 years (71).
Pediatric group (0–9 years) also had a high count (62 patients).
Emergency cases are concentrated among teenagers and middle-aged groups.

#Departmental Referrals
Majority of patients did not require departmental referral.
Among referrals, General Practice and Orthopedics were the most common.
Very few cases needed Neurology, Renal, Cardiology, or Gastroenterology consultations.

# Actionable Recommendations
Reduce Wait Times: Streamline triage and optimize resource allocation.
Minimize Delays: Improve staff scheduling and patient flow management.
Focus on Key Age Groups: Prepare for high caseloads in teenagers and middle-aged patients.

Strengthen Referral Areas: Ensure additional support in General Practice and Orthopedics.

Maintain High Satisfaction: Continue effective feedback and follow-up care systems.
